Problem Statement:

Build a machine learning model to predict whether the shipment will arrive on time or not. ( column ‘Reached.on.Time_Y.N’ from the attached data needs to be predicted )

You can consider that shipment which would arrive late is a higher risk for business. So, predicting potentially delayed shipments would be a big win so that business can take necessary steps to mitigate the issues.

Evaluation will be based on

Missing value imputation method ML model built. Model fine tuning Results
